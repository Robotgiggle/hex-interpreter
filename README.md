# hex-interpreter
Hexpattern interpreter for the Hex Casting mod.

A hexpattern consists of a string of letters representing turn directions, followed by a direction from which to start.
Here's an example: qeewdweddw northeast

To use this tool, just run the python script and input your hexpattern. If you enable gradient mode, the line will change color over time with a continuous gradient rather than the default behavior of changing colors only when it overlaps itself. Gradient mode can make the pattern look nicer, but it will be harder to determine the stroke order for large patterns.
