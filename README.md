# hex-interpreter
Hexpattern interpreter for the Hex Casting mod

A hexpattern consists of a string of letters representing turn directions, followed by a direction from which to start
Here's an example: qeewdweddw northeast

To use this tool, just run the python script and input your hexpattern. The "intersect mode" determines how the resulting image will be styled - selecting "y" will cause the line to change color whenever it intersects itself, while selecting "n" will cause the line color to use a continuous gradient.
